# Blackjack

I have designed and built a first player game where you will need to beat the dealer in a game of blackjack. The game will provide the ability to deal (receive cards) hit (get a new card) & stand (stick with your cards). The amount of wins, loses & draws are recorded.


## Gameplay

## Tech stack being used

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS Card Library

## Getting Started

- Please visit: https://mselbekk11.github.io/project-1-blackjack/
- Enter your name and press "Play Game"
- If you need a refresher on the rules of Blackjack, please click the question mark icon at the bottom right corner of the viewport.
- You will receive 2 cards. It is your choice how many times you want to click 'Hit'. The aim is to get closer to the number 21 than the dealer.
- Once you are either happy with your cards, or you have exceeded 21, click 'stay' which will calculate who has won and tell you at the top of the viewport.
- You will be able to see the amounts of wins, losses and draws recorded at the bottom of the viewport.

## Next Steps

I would like to implement betting into this game next. I would like to give the player the option to bet in $1, $5, $10, $20 increments. If a hand is won, the bet will be added to the players balance, and if the hand is lost, the bet will be deducted.
